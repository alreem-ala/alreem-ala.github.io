## Introduction
In order to build a broader network of resources that can be accessed by the public, several libraries come together to form a system known as a federated library. One of the main advantages of a federated library is the ability to investigate links between items that might not be immediately visible and we can better grasp the cultural and historical setting in which these things were produced by analyzing them simultaneously.

For this assignment, the two items I picked to analyze from yhr Digital Library of the Middle East are from the category "Naturmort" which is "Still Life" in English.

## Analysis
To start with, I found an item that is titled "Natürmort", I decided to look that up to find a similar item to compare it to. For the two of these items, their metadata is in the original language which is Turkish. The item to the left is created by Elif Naci, whereas the item to the right is created by Akdik, Şeref in 1965. The item to the left is not given a date ("Tarihsiz") since it does not appear to be signed by the creator.

Both of these items are made with the same materials/techniques, "Tuval üzerine yağlıboya", which is "Oil on Canvas". Nevertheless, we can see from the images that the item on the right has a thinner canvas than that on the right.

As for the left painting, its measurements are 41 x 27 cm while the right painting is 73 x 60 cm. Given the metadata and the images, we can see that they're both painted vertically. Both are of type "Resim" (Picture), and come from the provenance "Akbank bağış" which indicates that they both originated from the same place. In addition, their holding institutions and data providers are also the same which is Sakip Sabanci Museum with rights to © Sabancı Üniversitesi Sakıp Sabancı Müzesi. Tüm hakları saklıdır.
