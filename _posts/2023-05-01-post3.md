# draft in progress 

## Introduction
For this assignment, I will be using images from the met and analyzing them using orange. 

### Orange
Orange is a set of free and open-source data mining and machine learning tools. It is aimed to serve as a visual programming interface for data exploration and analysis. Orange offers a wide range of tools, such as data analysis and visualization, text mining and natural language processing. 

### The Met 
The Metropolitan Museum of Art, also referred to as the Met, is one of the largest and most famous art museums in the world. The Met Museum is home to an extensive and varied collection of works of art and artifacts from many different cultures and cultures. Its collection includes cultures from all across the world and covers more than 5,000 years of human history. 

## Analysis
To begin with, I have gathered 30 images of both watercolor and oil paintings.

### Hierarchical Clustering Method

- According to the image above, the algorithm did not cluster the paintings according to classification/medium but rather by the content of the artworks.

<em> group 1 </em>

<img src="/assets/group2.png" style="zoom:50%"/>
<em> group 2 </em>

<img src="/assets/groupp3.png" style="zoom:50%"/>
<em> group 3 </em>

- By focusing on the smaller clusters we can see that each group has a specific detail that all images share (e.g. group 1 has a lot of greenery, group 2 has more vibrate colors, and group 3 kind of represents fall season in which there are barely leaves on the trees and a few clouds in some of the pictures.)

### Classification Method

For this method, I have gathered 98 images of 10 different artists. The images can be found here. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rt80kFvDdTnjLp4qRm4c5c1YhGHA2HsC?usp=share_link">

As for the confusion matrix (below), we can see that various artists are mixed up.
