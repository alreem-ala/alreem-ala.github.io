## Introduction
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a compilation of 12 short stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, a renowned british writer. 


## Analysis
For this analysis, I decided to use Voyant tools. Doing this computer-assisted analysis is more efficient than a linear read since that would take a lot of time to figure out the frequent words, etc. A computer-assisted analysis also allows us to see larger sets of data. For this particular corpus, a linear read would have been very difficult to do within this time frame especially since there are 12 short stories. I found that the format of the corpus is sufficient enough to analyze it. 

According to the word cloud tool Cirrus, "said" is the most frequent word in the corpus.

This shows that there are many sayings throughout the text. The tool WordTree also shows the word "said" followed by a quote or comma.

Interestingly, the DreamScape tool examines the places mentioned in the text. Through that, the tool makes an animated map of the cities/countries that the characters have been to.

This tool also highlights every place and makes an arrow to the ones that are correlated with it. One other thing I noticed is that it goes through the entire text and animates the map according to chronological order. As we can see, the map highlights London the most of out all, which makes perfect sense since Sherlock Holmes is from London.
