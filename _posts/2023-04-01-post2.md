## Introduction
The adventures of sherlock holmes is a compilation of 12 short stories by sir arthur conan doyle, a renowned british writer. 


## Analysis
For this analysis, I decided to use Voyant tools. Doing this computer-assisted analysis is more efficient than a linear read since that would take way too much time to figure out the frequent words, etc. A computer-assisted analysis also allows us to see larger sets of data. For this particular corpus, a linear read would have been very difficult to do within this time frame especially since there are 12 short stories. 

The format of the corpus is sufficient enough to analyze it. 

According to the word cloud, "said" is the most frequent word in the corpus.

This shows that the tools do not disregard common words and proceed to count them as the most frequent word in the text.
